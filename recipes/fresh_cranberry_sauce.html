        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Fresh cranberry sauce is a must for your Thanksgiving dinner.
            Made with just 3 ingredients, this easy cranberry sauce is perfect 
            alongside turkey but it can also be used as filling for cranberry 
            and cream cheese tarts or a tasty topping on bagels, cornbread, or 
            cheesecake.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 cup of water</li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 (12 ounce) package fresh cranverries
                (such as Ocean Spray)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Bring water to a boil in a saucepan; add sugar and cook until
                sugar is dissolved, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir cranberries into the saucepan and bring to a boil. 
                Reduce heat to low, and simmer until cranberries have popped and 
                sauce is chunky, about 10 minutes or longer for desired consistency. 
                The longer you cook it, the less chunky it will be.</li>
            <li>Pour sauce into a serving dish or jars and cover until ready to use;
                the pectin in the cranberries will make the cranberry sauce gel as 
                it cools.</li>
            <li>Mix cranberry sauce with a fork before serving.</li>
        </ol>
